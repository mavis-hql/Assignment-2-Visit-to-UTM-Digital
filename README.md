### Reflection
<p>
  From the visit to UTM Digital, I get to experience more about how it feels like working in there and also get to talk to experienced ICT Officer, Madam Aslinda to 
  learn more about UTM Digital. We were given a chance to visit the open office, the UTM digital care unit and the data centre.
</p>
<p>
  The open office is where the staffs do their work in an open space. The UTM digital care unit is where the students complaints/problems that are related to ICT are being solved. For example,
  problems related to student ID, UTM smart application and UTM wifi.
  The data centre is important to support the software applications of the university.
</p>
<p>
  I am really grateful for being given the chance to pay a visit to UTM Digital and I enjoyed my visit because of the interesting structures of the office and the friendly staffs who were
  giving us the clear explanation about UTM digital. The open office is my favourite part of UTM digital because it is different from the traditional office set up.

  This is the UTM digital care unit. We didn't manage to take any pictures of the data centre for security measures.
